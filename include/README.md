# TFT_eSPI configuration (User_Setup.h)

Before compiling and uploading the FreeTouchDeck.ino sketch, you will have to edit the **User_Setup.h** file included with the TFT_eSPI library to match the setup you have. This can be found in your Arduino skechtbook folder under "libraries". If you have not renamed the TFT_eSPI library folder, the file **User_Setup.h** can be found in **TFT_eSPI-master**.

You can use the files in this directory as an example for different boards and screens. Simple rename the file that matches your combination of board and screen to `User_Setup.h` and replace the file that is in the library folder. You can also copy the contents of a file and replace the contenst in the existing `User_Setup.h`

If there is a wiring diagram available, it is a .png image with the same name.
