  My thanks goes out to Brian Lough, Colin Hickey, and the people on my Discord server
  for helping me a lot with the code and troubleshooting! https://discord.gg/RE3XevS

  FreeTouchDeck is based on the FreeDeck idea by Koriwi. It uses the TFT_eSPI library 
  by Bodmer for the display and touch functionality and it uses an ESP32-BLE-Keyboard fork 
  with a few modifications. For saving and loading configuration it uses ArduinoJson V6.

  FreeTouchDeck uses some libraries from other sources. These must be installed for 
  FreeTouchDeck to compile and run. 
  
  These are those libraries:

      !----------------------------- Library Dependencies --------------------------- !
      - Adafruit-GFX-Library (version 1.10.0 or above), available through Library Manager
      - TFT_eSPI (version 2.2.14 or above), available through Library Manager
      - ESP32-BLE-Keyboard (forked) (latest version) download from: https://github.com/DustinWatts/ESP32-BLE-Keyboard
      - ESPAsyncWebserver (latest version) download from: https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer
      - AsyncTCP (latest version) download from: https://github.com/me-no-dev/AsyncTCP
      - ArduinoJson (version 6.16.1 or above), available through Library Manager

      --- If you use Capacitive touch ---
      - Dustin Watts FT6236 Library (version 1.0.1), https://github.com/DustinWatts/FT6236
      
  The FILESYSTEM (SPI FLASH filing system) is used to hold touch screen calibration data.
  It has to be runs at least once when using resistive touch. After that you can set 
  REPEAT_CAL to false (default).

  !-- Make sure you have setup your TFT display and ESP setup correctly in TFT_eSPI/user_setup.h --!
        
        Select the right screen driver and the board (ESP32 is the only one tested) you are
        using. Also make sure TOUCH_CS is defined correctly. TFT_BL is also be needed!

        You can find examples of User_Setup.h in the "user_setup.h Examples" folder.
